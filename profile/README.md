# Overview
We are building a web app that converts academic readings into easy to digest formats, rather than the typical dense presentation. User will be able to input digital copies of their assigned readings and customize a format that sustains their attention.
## Problem Statement
Assigned academic readings are typically long and dense, which are hard to sustain attention and complete for some audiences.
### Why
Over 80% of survey respondents who struggle sustaining attention when completing academic readings reported they fully complete their readings <= 50% of the time. Peer-reviewed literature identify reduced attention spans in young adults due to current forms of media. Students generally agree that understanding readings fully results in better course outcomes
### Success
The rate of academic reading completion amongst college student increases. The target audience/user is able to complete academic readings completely rather than skimming, resorting to AI summaries, or skipping the reading entirely.
### Audience
College students, ages 18-22, who struggle with reading comprehension or sustaining attention
## Technologies Used
- React (Javascript, HTML, CSS)
- Cloud database
- Generative AI API (needs to be open-source or low-cost)
- Text-to-speech program
- Desktop + Mobile capability, probably using React Native
